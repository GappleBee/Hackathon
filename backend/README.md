# Important

To run the whole website (including the API), you need to boot up **two** servers: the server for the frontend and the one for the backend (the API).
**Before sending requests to the backend server, ensure you have created the database and ensure that the backend server is running**

# How to create the database

The database isn't created for you when you boot up the server for the first time but is still essential for basically everything this API does

If you are on Windows, install Python then go into the same directory as the manage.py file and run the following commands in order:

`python manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrate`

If that didn't work then you need to add Python to your system's PATH environment variables and then try running the command again

If you are on Mac or Linux then you don't need to worry as Python is installed and added to the environment variables by default

# How to boot up the backend server

Simply go into the same directory as the manage.py file and run:
`python manage.py runserver`

If the server has started up successfully then it should say something along the lines of:
```console
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

Django version 5.0.7, using settings 'backend.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

# How to send requests from frontend

Normally, if you try to send a POST request to `/api/register` with some data it won't work, under the hood, it needs to send data to your backend server which is usually hosted on your system along with the route as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/register`. What you can do instead is set up a proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` so it redirects unrecognised routes like `/api/register` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/register`

# How to test the API with whatever requests you want

To do this, go into the test-api.rest file and follow the instructions there, there are also some requests already made for you to send to the server
